Hike Washington CodeFellows 301 Final Project

### Group Process

##### Use Waffle.io for tracking issues:

* Put an 'M' at start of issue when creating; add 'MVP' label.
* Stretch goals get the 'enhancement' label

##### Github/Git Flow:

* Branch names should include M if MVP issue, the issue number, and descriptive name, eg. 'M#13-add-database' or 'cleanup#15'.
* After 5 pull requests, all work stops. Merge Party!
* Merge Party at the start (after standup meeting) and end of every day (5pm).
* Never merge your own branch!

##### General Stuff:

* Clear comments on all code so others can tell what it does. (We'll clean them off before deployment)

* If you see a variable name, etc., that is not self-explanatory, ask about it!
