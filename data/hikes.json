The singletrack at Tiger Mountain is a great training ground for those learning how to ride technical trails and is especially challenging on wet days. Preston Railroad Grade is also fast but more technical than the Summit Trail, with roots, rocks, some gnar sections and some switchbacks.  It requires very little pedaling in the downhill direction, but can be ridden either way.  It's a challenge in the climbing direction!  Blue Square on the way down, Black Diamond for the way up.",

At mile 2 take a Right and around a gate onto the Lost Lake Tr, although still an old Forest Service rd this one hasnât been used in so long its overgrown to the point its almost back to Singletrack. At 3 miles the trail crests the ridge and starts downhill, at 3.2 there is a singletrack heading south, this is the Lost Lizard Tr that also runs into the DNR area. From here down to the lake the trail is fairly overgrown and rides along a ridge high above the lake so it is never really accessible. The trail will be slick with a few soft spots after a rain. At about 5.5 miles you reach then north end of the lake and start down the other side, this is a decent singletrack that runs through a slight canyon past some cool rock walls. At 6.5 miles the trail widens back out to a doubletrack and passes several other trail intersections, all well signed, staying on the main trail will keep you going the right way. (Some of these can be added as part of the ride, consult TH maps.) A fast run downhill for another mile or so and the trail comes to a T, this is the Hemlock tr, turn left here and shortly after at a Y (near a house) turn right. This .5 mile section is fairly steep &amp; fun with some switchbacks, small drops, etc. follow this downhill  until you come to a main trail at the bottom, this is the Interurban tr. Take a left (Turning Right will lead you back into Bellingham) and ride more singletrack till about mile 9, here is a switchback to the right that will lead back down to the parking lot at the North Chuckanut Mtn trailhead. &lt;br /&gt;<br />Continuing on the Interurban tr another 4 miles will take you south back to the Clayton Beach Trailhead adding up to a 13 mile loop.&lt;br /&gt;<br />",

			"description": "Located in the northeast portion of Olympic National Forest, Louella Cabin offers guests a unique lodging experience. It was built in 1912 by Forest Service employee,  E. M. Cheney, who dedicated the structure to his wife, Louella. A fireguard was stationed at the cabin during the summer and fall.     During the Great Depression, a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp was built in the lower part of the meadow below the cabin and consisted of barracks, a bathhouse  and mess hall. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the CCC worked on many projects in the area, including fire lookouts, trails, bridges, roads and planting trees after  forest fires. After the CCC camp closed in 1939, the guard station was used by various agencies until 1976.     Today, the site offers guests year-round recreation and relaxation in Olympic National Forest. Access to the cabin is by vehicle; however, snow chains may be required in winter. The cabin offers several amenities, but guests will need to bring a few of their own supplies for a truly enjoyable stay.",

The county bought the land as a Conservation area (about 800 acres) for wildlife and wetlands protection around 2003 and closed access to the whole area. After several years and a lot of work primarily by local Mountain Bikers a portion of the area was re-opened with re-routed more environmentally friendly trails. The area consists of approx. 12 miles of trails although only about 8 miles of trails for biking. There are a few walking only trails (please respect these) and one bike only trails but most are open to bikes, hiking and horses. The Mainline trail is fairly smooth but does have some light rooty sections and two slight hills. It does not make a loop requiring either backtracking or taking other trails (which are much rootier and twistier) back to the main parking lot. Most of the other trails are fairly rooty with lots of twists and turns and only a few climb/descents. The trails are primarily somewhere between advanced beginner and intermediate in difficulty with the main challenge being roots, lots of exposed roots. Recent trails work in the past few years has eliminated much of the mud that had been a real issue during the winter here in the Pacific North Wet.",

You'll also pass two old bathtubs used as stock watering troughs when this was a working ranch.

One loop is open all year with full services.Two other loops are available if needed.",

Ride with care as hikers, runners, and equestrians use these trails extensively. <br /><br />From the parking area, ride back toward the campground entrance and find the Green Line 6 and Trail 8 access trail. Stay on the main trail - ignoring spurs - as you wind down to Waddell Creek, 0.3 mile. At creekside, bear right and pedal for a short distance to a bridge, 0.4 mile. Cross the bridge and ride up the trail on the opposite bank. The trail switchbacks up to a fork - turn right (passing the 'DO NOT ENTER' trail on the left). Pedal up a steep hill to a road at 0.6 mile. Ignore a singletrack back to the right just prior to the road. Ignore another trail straight across the road. Turn right onto the road. At 0.65 mile, ignore yet another trail on the right. When the road divides at 0.7 mile, bear left and ascend. At 0.8 mile, find the Waddell Loop Trail on the left and take it. <br /><br />At 1.5 mile, cross a gravel road and continue down the beautiful trail on the opposite side. Ignore a trail back on the right at 1.6 miles. When the trail splits again, turn right, riding away from the Firearms Impact Area. At 1.8 miles, bypass two trails on the right and continue ascending gently through a clearcut on a loose trail. At 2.2 miles, reach a T at Green Line Trail 6 and turn right on Mima-Porter Trail 8. At 2.4 miles, cross a road. The trail narrows. At 2.8 miles, bypass a lesser trail on the right. Cross over a bridge at 2.9 miles. Ignore a trail on the right at 3.1 miles. When the trail forks at 3.8 miles, go left (the right fork is Trail 10). Just after a bridge at 3.9 miles, reach a fork and bear left. <br /><br />Arrive at Mima Falls, 4.2 miles. At 4.7 miles, after a downhill traverse to a bridge and a short climb, reach a road. Continue on the trail across the road. The trail crosses another road at 5.1 miles. From here, a long grueling hill begins. Ride straight across another road to the trail on the opposite side, 6.2 miles. The climbing and switchbacking continue up to 7.3 miles, where the trail levels somewhat. Stay on the main trail, ignoring the short spur roads. At 7.8 miles, ride across another road to the trail opposite. At a 4-way intersection, 8.2 miles, continue straight on the main trail. <br /><br />At 9.4 miles, reach an intersection of gravel roads - D-4000 and D-5000. Find the trail diagonally across the intersection. At a fork in the trail, 9.9 miles, turn left, staying on Mima-Porter Trail 8. (A right turn onto Trail 20 shortens the ride by 7 miles; pick up the ride again at the 17.4-mile mark when Trail 20 intersects with Green Line Trail 6.) From the intersection, the rocky trail descends along Lost Creek to its confluence with Sherman Creek at 11.5 miles. Just before Sherman Creek, the trail divides - turn right, riding up Sherman Creek on Mima-Porter Trail 8. The trail up Sherman Creek changes from smooth to muddy to rocky, crossing numerous bridges in various states of repair. <br /><br />At 14.4 miles, reach the junction with Green Line Trail 6. Turn right onto Trail 6, toward the McKenny Camp. (Fall Creek Camp sits across Sherman Creek to the left.) From here, the climbing begins in earnest. Cross a road to the trail on the other side, 16.4 miles. Pass Trail 20 on the right at 16.6 miles - stay on Trail 6, left. At 16.9 miles, cross a road. At 17.1 miles, ignore a trail off to the right; stay on the singletrack. At 17.4 miles, the trail parallels a gravel road then drifts away from it. Cross gravel roads at 17.8 miles and 18.0 miles. From here the route drops quickly down a very rough trail. <br /><br />At 20.2 miles, a gravel road marks the junction of Trail 6 and Trail 10. Turn left just before the road, to remain on Green Line Trail 6 toward McKenny Camp. When the trail forks at 20.6 miles, turn left onto Trail 6A. At 20.8 miles, cross a dirt road. At 21.1 miles, ignore a trail on the left then immediately cross a road to the trail opposite. Things should look familiar. When the trail forks at 21.2 miles, bear right and descend to Waddell Creek. From the creek, ride up the access trail to the McKenny Camp parking area, 21.7 miles.<br /><br />Directions: From Seattle, take Interstate 5 to Exit 95 south of Olympia. The exit ramp wraps around to Highway 121. Set your odometer to zero when you reach Hwy 121, then turn left (west) toward Littlerock.

			"description": "From the trailhead at the top of the Smith Creek drainage, take a good long look downstream at your hike-a-bike future. If you are still inclined to surf the pum down into Smith Creek (and then pedal back out), go back to your car and load up on more energy bars, warm clothes, and a flashlight for good measure (even though you're making a decision that doesn't make much good sense). With a few more racks of fig bars in tow, start down Smith Creek Trail 225 on an easy traverse that belies the radical drop-off that lurks around the first corner.<br /><br />Serious pum surfing and switchbacking hike-a-bike begin as the trail careens down the wide ridge toward the creek. In some sections the trail is distinct, compact, and ridable; in others, no trail seems to exist as wands and red f**ing guide you through dense shrubbery and across washouts. Near the valley floor on a long, westward traverse, the trail becomes even more difficult to follow despite the f**ing. Stick with it and you will eventually find wood posts that mark the route across the small middle fork of Smith Creek, 3.6 miles.<br /><br />Across the creek, find the faint trail and bear left, riding down the long rise between the two forks of Smith Creek. Use the tall wood posts to follow the trail, which is sometimes obvious and fast, other times difficult to follow and slow. At 5.1 miles, the trail abandons the rise between forks, bearing right and crossing Smith Creek's west fork. <br /><br />WHOA! From here the trail is again difficult to follow. Across the creek, bear left and hike-a-bike south. With luck you will soon find the trail. At 6.3 miles, the trail crosses Ape Canyon Creek. Watch the route carefully: It is crucial to cross at the correct spot so you can find the trail that heads away from the creek, climbing. Hike-a-bike to the 6.7-mile point.<br /><br />From here, the trail opens up and becomes considerably more ridable. At around 8 miles the trail again climbs away from Smith Creek. At 8.4 miles, the trail widens to become an old road. Follow the road down, ignoring both a spur road and then Trail 184, both on the right. Continue down the road to the creek that flows out of Lava Canyon. Only half the bridge remains - a washout - requiring a dangerous ford. From the opposite side, ride down the road, FR 8322, passing a gravel parking area and a lesser spur road on the right.<br /><br />At 9.7 miles, the low point of the ride, FR 8322 bears right and begins climbing out of the Smith Creek valley. The road heads up at a steady climb. Pass a spur road on the left at 10.3 miles. At 13.6 miles, ignore a spur back to the left. When you reach a T at 13.9 miles, turn right. At 14.4 miles, reach another T - turn right on paved FR 83. The paved road drops, crosses the appropriately named Muddy River, and ends at Ape Canyon Trailhead.<br /><br />From the trailhead, pedal up Ape Canyon Trail 234, tracing the east edge of**igantic mudflow. After some relatively easy twists and turns, the trail enters a forest of big trees and mounts a ridge that - amazingly - escaped much of the St. Helens eruption unscathed. The trail, steep and unrelenting though smooth and ridable, switchbacks up the ridge through a seemingly normal forest. However, occasional views off the ridge of trees strewn like matchsticks and huge, gray mudflows prove how anomalous this small patch of forest is so close to Mount St. Helens.<br /><br />By the 19-mile mark, most of the difficult climbing is over. At 19.6 miles, stop to appreciate the haunting views of the mountain above and Ape Canyon below. Reach a fork, 20.1 miles, and bear right. Soon after, the trail bends north and enters the Plains of Abraham, a gigantic pumice shoulder on the east side of Mount St. Helens, which is peppered with black rocks that seem to float in the pumice like miniature icebergs. The trail across the Plains of Abe is fun and quick with some ups and downs; watch out for other trail users and yield to them all. At 21.9 miles, the trail forks: Go right.<br /><br />The trail traverses, winding in and out of several drainages before emerging at the top of a knife-edged ridge, 23.2 miles. The trail mimics the top of the ridge as it heads down. You will need to carry your bike down several sets of stairs that begin at 23.5 miles. After negotiating the stairs, continue down the ridge top. At 24 miles, reach a dirt road and turn right. Climb up this gated dirt road toward Windy Ridge Viewpoint. At 25.8 miles, arrive at the viewpoint parking area. Bear to the right on the paved road, FR 99, and continue the ascent back up to Smith Creek trailhead on the right, 27.4 miles, to complete the loop. (Taken from NWsource)<br />FR 99 IS CLOSED AT THE BEAR MEADOWS VIEWPOINT, SO BE PREPARED TO ADD  22 MILES TO YOUR LOOP.  We had to do quite a bit more hike a bike then what is written in the trail description due to the loose nature of pumice but, there was plenty of great singletrack and the views are simply amazing.

The big late winter/early spring drawdown of Lake Roosevelt is probably one of the best times to go. This way you can hike along the beaches of Hawk Creek just as folks did 10,000 years ago. You probably won’t make it to the Columbia River confluence, but you’ll get close enough to see it. If you head out when the water levels are high, there are still some upland hikes that treat you to some pretty spectacular pre and post-Pleistocene landforms (glacial terraces at several levels, Missoula Flood remnants, basalt escarpments, even pillow basalts over 5 million years old!) Numerous deer trails and old roads and trails (unmarked) easily get you around up here.<br />This is a great little trek under 5 miles RT, with about 900’ overall elevation gain. It was pretty muddy on the way in but gets better up high. The views are spectacular, the wildlife abounds, and the serenity is hard to beat.",

Take one to extend this loop with much more single track or proceed back to the lake on main trail. At the top of Hamby hill follow the logging spurs (A-1400) out to the main logging road (the Montesano A-line). Head right down the hill and at the crest of the next hill keep a close lookout for the start of Silvia Ridge trail in deep forest. Follow this perfect deep woods single track along the ridge (crossing two small spurs) until it opens out onto a wide intersection. The Silvia Ridge trail continues on down the hill but that section has just been destroyed (Winter 03) by a commercial thinning operation (this is a multi-use City of Montesano managed forest). At this intersection follow the major spur (b-300) to the right past a locked gate through the forest until you crest a hill opening into a very large clearcut. Stay to the right (left is another out, but a poor choice) down the hill across the clearcut and back to another crest as you near the lower timber line. The next single track section called Pine Winder (Pine something, no sign) begins on the left from that crest and winds down and across the ridge utill it dumps you just inside the treeline on to the Silvia Creek trail. Hang a left and return to the Lake from which you began.",

The trail at this point provides a nice view of dayton, is convenient if you live in town or are passing through, and could use as much traffic as it could get, to help it mature into a nice, smooth trail.  There is a good push to the top level, then there is a &quot;circuit&quot; around the top that is pleasing. There will be some jumps being put in up top. Also, there is currently a switchback being put in by yours truly.

Beyond the junction, the trail grade moderates as the trail goes on into Esmerelda Basin through meadows and groups of trees. There are some switchbacks along the trail as it continues upwards. Past the junction with County Line Trail 1226.2 (formerly a part of 1394 which heads north towards Lake Ann), the trail goes over a ridge and then down a series of switchbacks into the south fork of Fortune creek, where it ends at the junction with FS 4WD301(4x 4).  <br /><br />Make a loop by climbing the 4x4 road up Fortune Creek to Gallagher Head lake, and down the De Roux trail back to the De Roux trailhead.

The trail follows a historic railroad route between the river and State Route 169, and passes through or near Renton, Maplewood, Cedar Mountain, Maple Valley, and Rock Creek. It offers views and access to Lake Washington, downtown Renton, Cedar River Park, Maplewood Golf Course, Ron Regis Park, Cedar Grove Park, and Maple Valley. The CRT also provides excellent views and access to the Cedar River along its length. Between Renton and Maple Valley the CRT is popular with bicyclists and skaters and provides both recreational and nonmotorized commuting opportunities. At Maple Valley the trail intersects the Green-To-Cedar Rivers Trail, which runs through central Maple Valley, then continues to the more secluded Rock Creek area and onto Landsburg in a wooded river valley. This soft-surface segment is popular with off-road bicyclists, joggers, walkers and equestrians. Parking is provided at both ends of the trail, and at numerous locations along its length.",

The clinb up the forest service roads is a pain(Ihate riding the roads) but the veiws of the Cascades is awesome! The ride down is pretty steep at times w/ tight switchbacks.<br />",

Once you get to the top, you will see extruded outcroppings of columnar basalt, concrete footings of an old fire lookout and best of all, spectacular views from the south side of Mt Rainier and the White River valley. The trail is named for Cal Magnusson, a long time Cascade mountaineer who worked at REI for 25 years with famed mountain climber Jim Whittaker. A recent acquisition of 83 acres on the south side of the park provides another access to the peak along gravel roads and even more spectacular views along the way. The new acquisitions also present an opportunity to develop an equestrian trail and other recreation amenities.",

Still gaining elevation to 7,220 feet the trail crosses the divide between Martin Creek and Foggy Dew Creek. Just beyond the high ground the Cooney Lake Trail is off to the right. Then the trail descends through scattered trees and exposed rock and boulders, eventually into dense subalpine forest to the junction with the Foggy Dew Trail. On the Foggy Dew Trail it's another 5 miles to the Foggy Dew Trailhead.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />This area is popular with motorbike users and is gaining popularity with mountain bikers. Specific Hazards/Difficulties: Be considerate of all trail users, when encountering stock on the trail, lean your bike against the cutslope of the trail. Talk to the horseriders so the stock can recognize your location and not feel threatened by your actions. Move off the lower side of the trail and continue talking to the animals until all have past. Mountain bikers and hikers can take their packs and bikes off the lower side of the trail with them, and talk to the animals to reassure them.

The trail does a loop. To the left it is steeper and gains elevation through a bunch of switchbacks. To the right it follows along the river for a couple miles before hooking to the left and climbing gently through a creek bottom. It curves more to the left until it tops the ridge above Falls Creek CG and drops down into the valley via the switchbacks you encounter immediately if you turned left instead of right.

This is still a fast ride. It is not steep. This trail will take you behind the state patrol station, but continue pass it heading south. We will then come to two trail signs; the first is &quot;Woody's&quot; and the second &quot;Mainstreet&quot;. I prefer the ride on &quot;Woody's&quot; so i will guide you from there. Take &quot;Woody's&quot; and continue to ride south. Then take the trail called &quot;Freeway&quot; and continue south as it takes you close to the freeway. This trail has many sharp switch backs. The &quot;Freeway&quot; trail will take you to the edge of a farm where it curves to the left and heads east. You are now on top of all the trails. Ride east to connect with the trails you wish to take to the bottom. The first trail is unmarked but widely known as &quot;bigtire&quot;. This is trail is not steep, but can be very fast and has many jumps, both natural and man-made. If you continue east along the farm however the trails become steeper and less ridden. The next trails you can ride are in order as follows: Fred&amp;Jons, X-cut, Baja, Slalom, Giant Slalom, Skateboard, Bump-n-Grind, Lost-n-Found, then the main trail on top &quot;Freeway&quot; curves left and turns in to the last trail called &quot;Slime&quot;.

Between the years 1933 and 1942, the station hosted several government programs such as the Emergency Relief Administration, Works Progress Administration  and the Civilian Conservation Corps. From 1942 to 1986, the cabin was a fireguard station, and from 1986 to 1994, it was used by Forest Service volunteers.     Today, the site offers guests a unique and comfortable lodging experience year-round in Olympic National Forest. The cabin is accessible by car.

This part of the trail is in great shape and fun as well. In just past 3 miles you arrive at Bolt Camp. There is a cabin here maintained by a forest service worker in his spare time. Just past Bolt Cabin there is a small landslide and a larger one a little distance up. Hike a bike can be done over the slides if careful. In a couple more miles the trail climbs up to the bluff and winds along above the river. The upper section of the trail goes past the Lower Falls Campground. This trail gains more elevation than it looks like on the map but it's worth it. Considered by most as one of the best low elevation trails in the state. This trail has become famous not only from word of mouth but has been featured in several magazines and calendars. Motorized use is not allowed on this trail. It is part of the C to C Route. The trail goes along high cliffs, especially in the falls area. The beauty of the area is awesome and so are the drop offs. Use extreme caution, along all areas next to the river.

During fire season, lookouts stayed  in the cabin, watching for lightning strikes and forest fires in the Skykomish drainage. Once the lookout located a fire or smoke, he or she would radio to the  Skykomish Ranger Station and give local landmarks to help firefighters locate the fire quickly.     During World War II, Evergreen Mountain Lookout was used as an Aircraft Warning Station, and then remained an active fire tower until the early 1980s. During  volunteer restoration efforts in the 1990s, the lookout was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.    The lookout tower must be accessed via a steep, scenic hike on the  Evergreen Lookout Trail . Some amenities are provided, but guests should be prepared to pack in many of their own supplies.",

If you want to get lost, this is the place to ride. This loop functions as an excellent introduction to Victor Falls. If you can find it, check out Jim Hendricks\\\\\\' map of the area, which remains remarkably accurate despite logging and some blocks of new houses. Of course more new houses are slated for this area, and logging (in advance of development) may obliterate or re-route even more trails. So be prepared for changes. It must be noted that for years our heroes at Hillside Farms Christmas Trees have allowed mountain bikers to park in the lot from January through the end of October. Don\\\\\\'t trash the parking area! Please respect the closure dates so they can sell trees - and they\\\\\\'d sure like it if you bought your Christmas tree there. It should also be noted that the landowner tolerates non-motorized use; be a good citizen out on the trails so we can keep it that way. &lt;br /&gt;",

			"description": "From the parking area, pedal away from 198th Avenue, up a dirt road known as the Main Access Road. At 0.2 miles, pass around a gate. Almost immediately, reach a 4-way and turn left onto a wide trail known as Elevator. Right away it narrows and ascends steeply. Stay on the main trail as you climb, ignoring two trails on the right. The trail crests and seems to end at a dirt road, 0.8 mile. Across the road on the right, though, the trail continues. From here, the trail, known as Route 66, winds then drops. Pass straight through a 4-way at 1.0 mile. At 1.2 miles, reach a T and turn left. At 1.4 miles, reach another T and turn right. Descend and then wind around a swale of low brush that contains the hulk of a white truck. Arrive at a T at 1.8 miles, and turn left. The trail ends at 198th Avenue at 1.9 miles - turn right and ride alongside the paved road. <br /><br />At 2.1 miles, find a singletrack that exits the road on the right and take it. The trail winds and twists. Ride straight through a 4-way at 2.4 miles. When the trail divides, 2.7 miles, stay to the right. Pedal straight through another 4-way at 2.9 miles. Reach a gravel road at 3.2 miles - hop on the slightly technical singletrack that continues on the opposite side. When the trail forks, bear right. Reach a T at a narrow road, 3.3 miles, and go right, descending. At 3.6 miles, reach a T and turn right. The narrow road forks at 3.7 miles - bear left. At 3.8 miles, immediately before reaching a T, turn right on a singletrack. Whoa - this is an easy turn to miss. <br /><br />The trail, narrow and winding, heads north and is at times brushy and overgrown, as blackberry vines lunge at unprotected skin and spiders, web and all, catch rides on the first bike through. After some good pedaling unmolested by a dividing trail, you\\\\\\'ll reach a wide dirt road, 4.3 miles. The singletrack begins again on the opposite side of the road after a short jog to the right. At 4.4 miles, ride straight through a 4-way. Stay on the main trail, known as Mustang, as it sweeps back and forth, in and out of the trees, then finally out again. Ignore a trail back on the right at 5.5 miles. Just beyond, the trail splits again and this time bear right.<br /><br />From here, still out in the open of a clearcut, the singletrack gradually widens. Reach a 4-way of dirt roads at 5.7 miles and proceed straight ahead. At 5.9 miles, arrive at a complicated 4-way intersection at a major gravel road - turn right onto the wide gravel road, ignoring the lesser cut-off road immediately prior on your right. Ride toward a conspicuous stand of trees about one quarter-mile ahead. When the road forks at 6.0 miles, bear right. Ignore a lesser road on the left at 6.1 miles. Bear left at the fork at 6.2 miles. Just when you\\\\\\'ve had enough of the road riding, find a singletrack on the right, 6.4 miles, that enters that conspicuous stand of trees. This trail is called Cut Your Bars, although after years of use it\\\\\\'s not quite that technical anymore. <br /><br />At 6.7 miles, the trail pops out at a 4-way (three roads, plus your trail). Turn right on the road. When the road forks at 6.9 miles, go left on a narrow dirt road. Ignore a tasty looking singletrack on the right at 7.0 miles. But at 7.1 miles, find another singletrack and turn right. This small area, often referred to as Snickers, bound by the narrow road behind and the Access Road ahead, contains a maze of fun, zippy trails - and a few tours through the maze are well worth your while. At 7.2 miles, reach a fork and bear left. At 7.3 miles, reach a fork and go right. Bear right again at the next fork, then drop down to reach Access Road at 7.5 miles, then turn left. When you arrive at the 4-way, 7.6 miles, you\\\\\\'ve connected the loop. Go straight through the 4-way, around the gate, and glide back to the parking area at the Christmas tree farm, 7.8 miles. <br /><br />Directions: From Bellevue, take Interstate 405 south to Exit 2 in Tukwila. Then head south on Highway 167 toward Puyallup. Take the Highway 410 Exit toward Yakima, and drive east just over 5.5 miles to Bonney Lake. Turn right on South Prairie Road E., and set your odometer to zero. At 1.5 miles, turn right on 214th Avenue E. At 2.4 miles, turn right on 120th Street E. Reach a T at 3.2 miles, and turn left onto 198th Avenue E. At 3.7 miles, find Hillside Farms Christmas Trees on the right. Show some mountain bike courtesy: Don\\\\\\'t litter or relieve yourself in the parking lot.<br /><br />",

Some of it is improved surface and some of it is natural.

Then it continues along the ridge still climbing where there are wonderful views. The trail follows the ridge line for 4.5 miles to the base of Sunrise Peak, then drops down to a meadow and pond, before climbing back to the ridge. The trail skirts Juniper Peak, Sunrise Peak and Jumbo Peak. The trail ends near Dark Meadows at Boundary Trail #1. Improvements are being planned. Check with Randle District for current information. Much of the trail along the open ridgetop takes you through an area that burned in 1902 and 1918, resulting in the beautiful meadows along the ridge today. This is a fun trail but with some more difficult sections. This trail was once used by sheepherders as a &quot;stock driveway&quot; from 1900 to the 1930s. Look for an old watering trough north of Jumbo Peak. This is a motorized trail but does not get a lot of use. It is part of the C to C Route.&quot;<br />",

You'll find outstanding wildflowers throughout the Badger Mountain area. In late spring, the flowers carpet the prairie with varied colors and textures. The nature of the flowers changes with the topography: On the rocky barren slopes buckwheat is dominant. In the lush open sagelands, you'll find desert lupine, balsamroot, white lupine, and brodiaea.",

Evergreen has been working on this project for 15 years, and as of September, 2009, the first 4 mile section of trail is ridable! Evergreen, in partnership with the US Forest Service and Mountains to Sound Greenway, secured grants to remove the first series of roads from the system and convert some of them into singletrack. Additional sections of trail will be converted as funds become available, eventually resulting in a 30 mile trail system. &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />Hansen Ridge trail is just over 4 miles each way. The climb is nice up the trail, and most will choose to do this ride as an 8 mile out-and-back, resulting in a total accumulated climb of about 1300 ft. The trail flows nice, and is a bit loose in places. The character of the trail will improve as Evergreen does trail finishing and maintenance. The trail is a comprised of two converted roads that connect with a trail about half way. The converted road/trails were made to simulate a trail out of a straight section of road and wind around from left to right with some small rollers and sections of rock and trees. The views from along the trail are spectacular, particularly on the upper segment. &lt;br /&gt;<br />The trail head is one of the most popular target shooting &quot;pits&quot; in the region. You will hear a lot of gunfire at the trail head.&lt;br /&gt;<br />",

There is some equestrian activity here also however they seem to stay more on the trails in the valley and around the Resort itself, several of the trails immediately around the resort area are for hikers only also, however these seem to be sandy and not much fun to ride in anyways.&lt;br /&gt;<br />There are many options for routes here however one suggested route would be to head up on Thompson rd / Meadowlark tr (DT) and come back down The Inside Passage, Rader Cr (fun ST) and then back around Patterson Lake (ST) to the Chickadee TH for close to a 10 mile loop.&lt;br /&gt;<br />",

It may be marked with a cairn. The trail curves around and heads back towards the rim of the canyon. It may be difficult to follow in places, but it basically stays near the rim of the canyon and the high ground above. Eventually the trail drops back down to a well defined trail leading back past Campbell Lake and back to Lester Road. Once back on Lester Road, head back toward the start, but watch to the right for another single track, possibly marked with a cairn that starts within a few hundred yards.

The state managed the facility for several years, but was unable to continue operation when budgets became strained. After the state closed the park, local farmers formed an organization and ran Crow Butte for the next four years. The farmers were having difficulty sustaining the maintenance of the park and asked the Corps of Engineers to lease the park to the Port of Benton effective August 1, 2007. &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />The Port's decision to invest in the park followed meetings with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and officials of Benton and Klickitat Counties. The two counties have supported and will continue to support the Port financially. This support has made the upgrades at the park possible. The Port developed a master plan which has led to recent upgrades in the park. The Port will continue to make improvements to the park over the next several years. The Port believes that this area of its district will continue to grow in economic importance as a result of wine and agri-tourism. The island on which the park is located is culturally significant to the tribes, leading to a ceremony on August 28th, 2007 in which the tribes formally blessed the park.",

And thank park staff for building the Shady Lane Trail in 1911 to replace the cedar staircase built in 1890.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />The bridge that made the loop possible perished in the mid 1990s, with the winter storms of the mid-2000s causing severe enough road damage to force closure of the access road during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />Having said all that, this is still the hike to get your nonhiking family hooked. It's short, it's easy and it's beautiful. The hike starts off crossing a large concrete bridge over the North Fork Skokomish. The trail leads gently into moss-covered forest. A short side trail leads you to the Giant Cedar. This is a must-stop for pictures. Continue back on the trail and you soon will be strolling along the raging, turbulent river. More photos needed here. The rapids and boulders are great backdrops. You shortly come to a junction in the trail. The right leads you to the end of the now-destroyed bridge that completed the loop trail. Take the left fork and continue on to Four Stream. Find a spot for lunch&lt;br /&gt;<br />",

		"description": "Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park is the gem of King County's 25,000-acres park system. Just minutes from Eastside cities such as Bellevue and Issaquah, the park is a natural oasis amid our rapidly developing region and offers ample recreational opportunities.  Located in the &quot;Issaquah Alps,&quot; Cougar Mountain showcases a variety of natural features from forests and waterfalls to meadows and cliffs. Sweeping vistas of the Cascades, Lake Sammamsih, and Bellevue, Seattle and beyond can found at different points throughout the park, while other, more densely vegetated areas of the park whisk you away from the sights and sounds of nearby urban development.  Cougar Mountain is a favorite trail destination, and in 2005, Trails.com ranked it 19th on the website's guide to the Top 100 trails in North America. The park's more than 36 miles of trails criss-cross the mountain and offer something for every outdoor enthusiast, from the hard-core trail runner to the family out for a short, kid-friendly hike. There are also 12 miles of trails for equestrian use.",
